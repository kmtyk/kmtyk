## Hi there
Hello.I'm Yuki Kamata, aka Yuki. My birthday is October first.
<br>I've been a scratcher since 2020 and a web developer since 2021.
<br>My favorite novel is "Nicole no tou" written by Kaori Komori. It's beautifully expressed and varied. I hope you all enjoy it as well.
<br>I'm a little known fan of YOASOBI, I've been playing tabletennis since when I was 12 y/o.
<br>I'm a LaTex user. I basically write mathematical expressions in LaTex. I'm learning Esperanto and English, which are considered universal languages.
<br>My hobbies are wandering the darkweb and virtual currency. I also invest and speculate.
<br>I reply to e-mails within a few hours.
<br>I may cause you some inconvenience, but I look forward to your continued support.
